I am a Data Analysts at [Lenovo](http://lenovo.com) working on their global data center team. I really enjoy discover valuable and hidden knowledge from data. I want to use this website to record my data exploration process.

Before that, I was a Change Analysts & Lean Six Sigma Black Belt at [IBM](WWW.ibm.com), with a background in medicine.
